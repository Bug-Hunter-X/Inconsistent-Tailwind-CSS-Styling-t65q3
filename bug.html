I'm using Tailwind CSS and sometimes my styles aren't applied correctly, even though I've included the correct classes and the Tailwind configuration seems fine.  For example, I might add a `bg-blue-500` class to a div, but it remains white. This is inconsistent; sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. No errors are showing in the browser's developer console or my build process.
