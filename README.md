# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Styling

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are intermittently applied.  Sometimes the styles work as expected, and other times they don't, despite no apparent errors in the code or build process.

## Bug Description

The issue is inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes. A class like `bg-blue-500` may sometimes render correctly (blue background) and other times not (white background). This occurs without any error messages in the browser's developer console.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that the background color may or may not be applied as expected.
4. Refresh the page multiple times to observe the inconsistent behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates potential solutions.  The core issue might be related to build processes, order of CSS inclusion, or conflicting CSS rules. The solution focuses on ensuring that Tailwind CSS's generated CSS takes precedence by addressing conflicts, correct class order and purging unused styles to prevent unexpected overrides.  Note that this is a simplified example, and the actual cause in your project might vary.
